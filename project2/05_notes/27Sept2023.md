1. **Import Required Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries, including `streamlit`, `os`, and `pandas` if you plan to use them for data processing.

2. **Define Folder Paths**: Specify the folder paths where you want to store and organize the uploaded files and other data. These paths will be used to create directories and save files.

3. **Create Working Directories**: Use a loop to create the necessary working directories if they do not already exist. This step ensures that the required folder structure is in place.

4. **Streamlit App Main Function**:

   - Use the `st.title()` function to set the title of the Streamlit app, which will appear at the top of the web page.

   - Create a file upload section using `st.file_uploader()`. This section allows users to upload files. You specify acceptable file types (in this case, both CSV and TXT) using the `type` parameter.

   - Check if a file has been uploaded. If a file has been uploaded, display a success message using `st.success()` to confirm that the file was uploaded successfully.

   - Save the uploaded file to the designated input directory. You can use the `os.path.join()` function to construct the full file path within the input directory and then write the contents of the uploaded file to that location.

5. **Run the Streamlit App**: Use the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to ensure that the app is run only when this script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module. This block calls the `main()` function to start the Streamlit app.

With these steps, your Streamlit app allows users to upload CSV and TXT files, and upon successful upload, it saves the files to the specified input directory. Users can interact with the app through a web browser.
