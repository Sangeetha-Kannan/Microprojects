## @st.cache 

The `@st.cache` decorator in the Streamlit code I provided is used to cache the result of the `load_data` function. Caching is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls so that they can be reused without recomputing them if the input to the function remains the same. 

In this specific case, the `load_data` function reads the raw data from a file. Reading data from a file can be a time-consuming operation, especially if the file is large. By using the `@st.cache` decorator, Streamlit will store the result of `load_data` in memory the first time it's called and then return the cached result on subsequent calls as long as the input parameters to the function (in this case, the file path) remain the same. This can significantly improve the performance of your Streamlit app, especially when working with large datasets.

The use of `@st.cache` is optional, but it's recommended when dealing with potentially slow or resource-intensive operations to make your Streamlit app more responsive.
